# wordy
A wordle clone for YAGPDB

This command set has 4 custom commands:
  -wordlist: The command to set the dictionary database
  -wordlist2: An extension of the first command to finish the database
  -wordy: The command to start a new puzzle
  -guess: The command to make a guess at the puzzle

Puzzles are uniquely assigned to users, so no one else can guess at someone else's puzzle.
Responses are tagged to a user, so multiple users can be doing puzzles simultaneously
